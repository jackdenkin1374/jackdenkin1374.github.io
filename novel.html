                            After the destruction of the Primals and their main forces collapsed and their means to travel to our realm is severed, peace and prosperity returns.<br>
                            The Primal main ship collapses into the ocean, becoming a new haven and civilization for humanity on Earth.<br>
                            Jack and crew reside in a city called Athrum. Jack can relax and do whatever, such as getting to test out a new high sync device that eventually leads to the converging of Earth and Xaeilara.<br>
                            Note: The eventual rifts and converging were the Primals yet again, trying to invade Earth with the reminder of there gathered forces.<br>
                            Their mistake was leaving behind their landship with all sort of resources and technology. Their means of traveling across space, visiting and raiding other planets in the universe.<br>
                            Xaeilara being one of those planets. Due to the primals trying to invade and Nexus active research and messing up here and there, they accidentilly started the convergence of two planets, to which Jack and crew got to fix, which lead to Jack becoming a god to fix this issue.
